
&2HOW TO PLAY : CREATIVE MODE

All information came from 
the actual console! All texts have 
been slightly edited. It's not 
recommended to follow everything 
from here.

The creative mode interface 
allows any item in the game to be
moved into the player's inventory
without the need for mining or
crafing the item.
The items in the player's inventory
will not be removed when they are 
placed or used in the world. This 
allows the player to focus on building
rather than resource gathering.
If you create, load, or save a world
in Creative Mode, that world will have
achievements and leaderboard updates
disabled, even if it is later loaded
in Survival Mode.
When in Creative mode, to fly
quickly tap the Space key (A Button)
twice. To fly faster, press
Shift + W (tap Left Stick & Forward
at the same time). To stop flying,
double press the Space key again.
When flying, you can hold the
Space key (A Button) to ascend
and Ctrl key (Right Stick) to
descend; or use [?]
key to move up, [?] to move down,
[?] to move left, and [?] to move
right.

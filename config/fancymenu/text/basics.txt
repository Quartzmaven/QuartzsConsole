Minecraft is a game about placing blocks to build anything 
you can imagine. At night monsters come out, so make sure to 
build a shelter before that happens.

Use the Mouse (Right Stick) to look around.

Use the WASD keys (Left Stick) to move around.

Press the Space key (A Button) to jump.

Press Shift + W (by default, or Push Left Stick forward) twice in 
rapid succession to sprint. While you hold Shift + W 
(Left Stick forward), you will continue to sprint until you run 
out of sprint time or have less than 3 drumsticks on 
your hunger bar.

Left Click on your mouse (or Hold Right Trigger) to mine and
chop using your hand or whatever you are holding. You may need 
to craft a tool to mine some blocks.

If you are holding an item in your hand press Right Click on 
your mouse (or Use Left Trigger) to use that item or press Q 
key (or the B Button) to drop it.

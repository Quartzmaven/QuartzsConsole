All information came from the actual console! All texts have 
been slightly edited. It's not recommended to follow 
everything from here.

The HUD shows information about your status; your health, 
your remaining oxygen, your hunger level, and your armor
(if you are wearing any).

If you lose some health but have 9 or more drumsticks, 
you health will automatically replenish. 
Eating food will replenish your drumsticks.

The Experience Bar is also shown here. The number 
shows your current Experience Level, and the bar 
indicates how many Experience Points are 
required to increase your Experience Level, and

The hotbar shows the items that are available to use. Use Left

the offhand slot will be used first.

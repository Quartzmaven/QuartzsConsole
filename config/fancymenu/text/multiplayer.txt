All information came from the actual console! All texts are 
slightly edited. It's not recommended to follow everything
from here.

Minecraft on the simulated PC console is a multiplayer game 
by default. If you are playing in a High Definition mode, you 
can have local players join your game by attaching 
controller and pressing the start button 
at any point during the game. 

When you start or join an online game it will be visible
to people in your friends list (unless you've selected
Invite Only when hosting the game), and if they join
the game, it will also be visible to people in
their friends list (if you have selected the
Allow Friends of Friends option).

When you are in a game you can press the back button to
bring up a list of all other players in the game, view
their Gamer Cards, Kick players from the game, and invite
others to the game.

# Quartz's Console Canary Builds
Early & unfinished previews of another Legacy Edition Remake for Java 1.19.2. Expect bugs and unfinished elements.
Beta builds are available on the [Quartz's Console](https://quartzsconsole.novassite.net) official website!

Note: These versions aren't finalized.

The GNU GPL License applies to Gamemode4's mod. I'm very dumb on how to license stuff.

# Quartz's Console
Legacy Edition Remake for Java 1.19.2.
Beta builds are available on the [Quartz's Console](https://quartzsconsole.novassite.net) official website!

1.3 is still in beta/canary stage.  Expect bugs and unfinished elements.

Note: These versions aren't finalized.

The GNU GPL License applies to Gamemode4's mod. I'm very dumb on how to license stuff.
